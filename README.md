# system_monitor
A lightweight, real time system resource monitor built in C++ using Dear ImGui, Win32, and DirectX, showing live CPU, RAM, and network statistics in a clean interface.

The purpose of this project was to get insight into System API calls (windows), Multithreading, and dipping my toes into Gui frameworks and APIs.
